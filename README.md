- ðŸ”­  I interned this summer (2020) at NASA JPL on the 2020 Mars Rover, and am continuing part-time through the fall academic semester.
- ðŸŒ±  In my spare time, Iâ€™m currently working on an [anonymous survey engine](https://github.com/The-Percentage-Project/survey-engine) for [The Percentage Project](https://percentageproject.com/#/), a non-profit working on collecting data and advocating for unheard voices in CS.
- ðŸ˜„  Pronouns: he/him/his
